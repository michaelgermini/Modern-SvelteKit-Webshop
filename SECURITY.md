- Automated security scanning
- Use of trusted, well-maintained packages

### 🔍 Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

```javascript
// Example security headers in SvelteKit
export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
  const response = await resolve(event);

  // Security headers
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  response.headers.set('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  response.headers.set('Permissions-Policy', 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()');

  return response;
}
```

## 🚦 Vulnerability Classification

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **High**: Significant security risk with potential for exploitation
- **Medium**: Security weakness with limited exploitation potential
- **Low**: Minor security improvements needed
- **Info**: General security suggestions

### Response Times by Severity

- **Critical**: Response within 24 hours, fix within 72 hours
